{"name":"Periodic Table Selector","tagline":"A WPF based selector control in the shape of the Periodic Table of Elements","body":"### What It Is\r\nThe Periodic Table Selector is a WPF control where the Chemical Elements can be selected. Since the Periodic Table and the Chemical Elements both happen to be WPF custom-controls, they can be re-styled and re-templated. By default, selecting a Chemical Element will activate a glow effect around the text and on the inside of the border. The color of the glow effect, the color of the foreground, and the color of the background can be set on a case by case basis on each Chemical Element. This might not sound very impressive, but people have been caught playing around with this for no other reason than to play with it. \r\n\r\nSince the Periodic Table control is a selector, a developer can bind to the selected Chemical Elements. This list of selected Chemical Elements can be changed by changing the selected state of a Chemical Element or add/removing a Chemical Element to the selected items list. The selected state of the Chemical Elements are updated when the list changes.\r\n\r\n### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
